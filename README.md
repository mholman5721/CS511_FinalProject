# CS511_FinalProject
This Git repository contains the final project for Dr. Hiromoto's CS511 Parallel Programming class, as completed by Paden Rumsey and Matthew Holman.

The project involved implementing seven different programs for solving 'boundary condition' matrix problems using both normal and parallel programming techniques. The parallel programming implementations made use of the [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/) API. The project involved collecting data and analyzing the results for a large number of trials of each program.

The final paper, referenced below, includes an appendix which describes the layout of this repository.
